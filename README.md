## Build
You need to download [GraphStream-core library](http://graphstream-project.org/download/) and add it to your build path

## Usage
The main class is *Main.java*. If you pass an argument, then the graph definition file will be read from that file, otherwise it will be read from stdin.

## Graph definition file
